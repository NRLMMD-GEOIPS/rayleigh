Installation Updates
====================

Return non-zero from build.py on fail
-------------------------------------

Ensure build.py returns non-zero if the make fails!  Otherwise pip will think
it completed successfully!

Also ensure pyproject.toml includes "numpy" as build dependency for fortran-based
builds!

Also ensure lib and inc are included in package_includes in pyproject.toml!
